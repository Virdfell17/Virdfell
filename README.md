# Acquaintance
### Hi there, my name is Aliia
#### I am a physicist, vegan, volunteer and a person who is looking for a profession that I will enjoy.

I have a Master's degree in Medical Physics and have worked in Radiology for over a year in my profession. 
Since moving to Thailand, I had to forget about being a physicist and try my hand at being a QA engineer. Unfortunately, I'm still a QA engineer with only a certificate in hand and almost zero commercial experience. All I can still boast of as a specialist are the test cases and checklists that I created during my training http://bit.ly/3FiJtB4

Skills: VMAT / IMRT / Jira / SDLC and STLC / API testing / MySQL

- Iâ€™m currently learning Thai and try to improve my English in order to feel better and more comfortable in a new country
